This is my Emacs configuration focused on being

- *Minimal*. I practise [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism][minimalism]] in my daily life, as well as in Emacs.
- *Manageable*. Advanced approaches are used to minimize the cost of managing the configuration.
- *Functional*. This configuration satisfies most of my daily needs.

For information like *"how to install"*​, see [[./init.org][init.org]].
