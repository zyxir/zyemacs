#+title: ZyEmacs

My Emacs configuration focused on being

- *Minimal*. I practise [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism][minimalism]] in my daily life, as well as in Emacs.
- *Manageable*. Advanced approaches are used to minimize the cost of managing the configuration.
- *Functional*. This configuration satisfies most of my daily needs. See [[*Usage]].

The whole config is inside [[./init.org][init.org]]. You can also read the [[file:CHANGELOG.org][changelog]].

* Usage
